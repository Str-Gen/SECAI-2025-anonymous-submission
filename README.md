# Anonymized code artifact submission for SECAI 2025

This repository contains 5 Jupyter Notebooks to showcase the workflow we have used throughout our analysis for the article: "Simplicity Performs, But Should It? Examining Malware Detection Benchmark Datasets".
Because of the anonymization requirements we cannot link to the public Kaggle versions of our datasets and analyses during review. 
However, the article does refer to our methodology which is why this repository shows the stages of our experiment for one of the datasets we have included.
